A new file is created here.
I can undo the deletion of file on my local drive via GitHub desktop as well. But technically, the file was not recovered locally as it is still in the trash right now. I guess it was recovered from the backup in the Github cloud.
Now I switch back to the master branch, and I see the version before the new branch was created (and changes being saved to the new one).
