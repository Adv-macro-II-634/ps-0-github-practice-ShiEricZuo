A new file is created here.
I can undo the deletion of file on my local drive via GitHub desktop as well. But technically, the file was not recovered locally as it is still in the trash right now. I guess it was recovered from the backup in the Github cloud.
Let's see whether this version goes to the new branch I just created.
